To run the performance tests, go to the base directory and run the following
on several terminals:

1. Start an xMsg node:

    $ ./build/src/sys/cx_proxy

2. Start the subscriber. Pass the message size and the expected number of
   messages:

   $ ./build/test/perf/local_thr localhost 50000 100000

2. Start the publisher. Pass the message size and the number of
   messages to be sent:

   $ ./build/test/perf/remote_thr localhost 50000 100000

Once all the messages have been received, the subscriber will print the
performance and throughput results:

    message elapsed: 4.081 [s]
    message size: 50000 [B]
    message count: 100000
    mean transfer time: 40.807 [us]
    mean transfer rate: 24505 [msg/s]
    mean throughput: 9802.000 [Mb/s]
